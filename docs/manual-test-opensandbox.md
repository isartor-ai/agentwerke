# Manual Test Scenario: OpenSandbox Rollout (Local Fallback, Deployment, Verification)

Version: Draft v0.1
Status: Active
Date: 2026-06-19

## Purpose

This scenario covers the OpenSandbox-first sandbox rollout described in `docs/decisions/ADR-003-use-opensandbox-control-plane-with-kata-runtime.md`:

- running sandboxed agent tasks locally without a Kata cluster (Docker mode, or the legacy direct-Docker fallback)
- deploying OpenSandbox in production with Kubernetes mode and a Kata (or Kata+Firecracker) secure runtime
- the security differences between the runtimes a sandbox can sit on
- how to verify each path, automated where practical and manual where it requires infrastructure this repo doesn't own

Agentwerke is a *client* of OpenSandbox's REST API (`Autofac.Sandboxes.OpenSandboxApiClient`/`OpenSandboxSandboxExecutor`). It does not deploy OpenSandbox itself, and it does not create sandbox pods directly when `Sandboxes:Provider` is `opensandbox`. The reserved `kubernetes-kata` provider (`Autofac.Sandboxes.KubernetesKataSandboxExecutor`) is a stub — it is the fallback architecture only if the OpenSandbox spike fails, per ADR-003, and is not used by either path below.

## Prerequisites

- Docker (or an OCI-compatible daemon) for the local path.
- A Kubernetes cluster with a secure-runtime-capable node pool for the production path validation (not required to read this document or run the local path).
- `dotnet test` runs from the repository root.

## Part A — Local development: OpenSandbox in Docker mode

This is the contributor loop: no Kata cluster, no Kubernetes — OpenSandbox's own server runs as a container and talks to your local Docker daemon underneath.

### Step 0: Run the automated workflow/agent/OpenSandbox E2E stack

Use this first when you want to prove the full Agentwerke path:

```bash
scripts/run-opensandbox-e2e.sh
```

Equivalent manual sequence:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.e2e.yml \
  --profile opensandbox \
  up --build -d \
  postgres-opensandbox migrate-opensandbox wiremock opensandbox api-opensandbox

curl --fail --retry 60 --retry-delay 2 http://localhost:8083/api/health/live

docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.e2e.yml \
  --profile opensandbox \
  build e2e-tests-opensandbox

docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.e2e.yml \
  --profile opensandbox \
  run --rm e2e-tests-opensandbox
```

This profile builds and starts:

- Postgres for an isolated OpenSandbox E2E database.
- A local OpenSandbox server in Docker runtime mode (`http://localhost:8089/health` from the host).
- An Agentwerke API instance configured with `Sandboxes:Provider=opensandbox` (`http://localhost:8083/api/health/live` from the host).
- The `OpenSandboxWorkflowE2ETests` runner.

The E2E test uploads a temporary agent through `POST /api/agents/upload`, imports and publishes a BPMN workflow that references that agent, starts a run, and asserts the service task completed through the `sandbox.execute` tool with the `offline` sandbox profile.

Expected result: the `e2e-tests-opensandbox` container exits with code 0 and the run step output contains `autofac-sandbox: task complete`.

The OpenSandbox log line below is expected in this local scenario and is not the failure:

```text
server.api_key is not configured. Proceeding because OPENSANDBOX_INSECURE_SERVER explicitly acknowledges the insecure server mode.
```

This stack intentionally runs the server in insecure local-dev mode (`OPENSANDBOX_INSECURE_SERVER=YES`). The actual failure mode to watch for is `api-opensandbox` never becoming healthy, or the `e2e-tests-opensandbox` container exiting non-zero.

### Step 1: Start an OpenSandbox server locally

Follow the OpenSandbox project's own Docker-mode instructions: https://github.com/opensandbox-group/OpenSandbox/blob/main/docs/architecture.md. In Docker mode the server typically listens on a local port (this scenario assumes `http://localhost:8080/v1`, matching `OpenSandboxProviderOptions.ServerUrl`'s default).

Expected result: the server's health/readiness endpoint responds, and you can create a sandbox against it with the OpenSandbox CLI or a plain `curl` per its docs.

### Step 2: Point Agentwerke at the local server

Set in `src/Autofac.Api/appsettings.Development.json` (or environment variables):

```json
{
  "Sandboxes": {
    "Provider": "opensandbox",
    "OpenSandbox": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "ServerUrl": "http://localhost:8080/v1",
      "ApiKey": "",
      "DefaultImage": "alpine:3.19",
      "UseServerProxy": false
    }
  }
}
```

`UseServerProxy: false` is correct here — the server is reachable directly from the host running the Agentwerke worker.

### Step 3: Run a sandboxed workflow step

Start a workflow that routes a service task through the `sandbox.execute` tool (e.g. `wf-pilot-004` or any agent task with `Sandboxes:Provider` enabled — see `Autofac.Agents.Tools.SandboxExecutionTool`). Confirm in the run's tool-invocation history that the step completed and artifacts were captured.

### Step 4: Run the gated integration tests against the real server

```bash
export AUTOFAC_OPEN_SANDBOX_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:8080/v1"
export AUTOFAC_OPEN_SANDBOX_API_KEY=""   # if your server requires one
dotnet test tests/Autofac.Sandboxes.Tests/Autofac.Sandboxes.Tests.csproj \
  --filter "FullyQualifiedName~OpenSandboxIntegrationTests"
```

Expected result: all `OpenSandboxIntegrationTests` pass — smoke execution, non-zero exit handling, sandbox cleanup on success, sandbox retention on failure when `RetainSandboxOnFailure` is set, and execution under each named `Autofac.Sandboxes.SandboxProfileCatalog` profile. Without `AUTOFAC_OPEN_SANDBOX_SERVER_URL` set, these tests no-op and pass — that's the CI-safe default.

### Step 4b: Local fallback without OpenSandbox at all

If you don't want to run an OpenSandbox server, the legacy direct-Docker path still works (`Sandboxes:Provider: docker`, the chart/compose default for local stacks). Verify it end to end against your local Docker daemon:

```bash
export AUTOFAC_DOCKER_SANDBOX_E2E=1
# Only needed if `docker context ls` shows your active context isn't the
# default socket (e.g. Rancher Desktop, a remote context):
export AUTOFAC_DOCKER_ENDPOINT="unix:///path/to/docker.sock"
dotnet test tests/Autofac.Sandboxes.Tests/Autofac.Sandboxes.Tests.csproj \
  --filter "FullyQualifiedName~DockerSandboxLifecycleIntegrationTests"
```

Expected result: real container execution, artifact capture, cleanup-on-success, and retention-on-failure (per `SandboxCleanupPolicy.RetainSandboxOnFailure`) all pass against your local daemon. This is the path the Docker Compose stacks (`docker/docker-compose*.yml`) use; it has no meaningful isolation boundary beyond an ordinary container and is documented as local-only — see the security table below.

### Step 5: Validate `agent_sandboxed`

`agent_sandboxed` is a different execution mode than the `sandbox.execute` tool path above: instead of an in-process agent calling a generic "run this in a sandbox" tool, the *entire* agent — model call, tool loop, the works — runs inside the sandbox container, via `OpenSandboxedAgentRunner` invoking `Autofac.AgentRunner.dll`. It's selected by an explicit `executionMode="agent_sandboxed"` BPMN attribute, or implicitly when the agent's `runner` is `claude-code` (see `AgentOrchestrator.ResolveExecutionMode`).

Because the agent needs to reach a model endpoint, `agent_sandboxed` always upgrades its effective network policy to `Restricted` with the model host allow-listed (`OpenSandboxedAgentRunner.BuildEffectiveSandboxProfile`), even when the BPMN task asks for the `offline` profile. That makes network policy enforcement load-bearing for this mode in a way it isn't for `sandbox.execute`.

#### Recommended: the CI-safe automated path (local Docker provider)

```bash
scripts/run-agent-sandboxed-e2e.sh
```

This brings up an isolated Postgres, the shared WireMock instance (now also stubbing the Anthropic Messages API — see `tests/Autofac.E2ETests/Fixtures/wiremock-anthropic-stub.json`), and an Agentwerke API instance with `Sandboxes:Provider=docker` (the legacy local-fallback provider — chosen here purely so the test doesn't need a real Anthropic API key; `agent_sandboxed` works the same way against a real OpenSandbox server, see "Validating against the pilot OpenSandbox stack" below). It builds and tags the `Autofac.AgentRunner` image the sandbox container runs, uploads a `runner: claude-code` agent and an `executionMode="agent_sandboxed"` workflow, starts a run, and asserts on `AgentSandboxedWorkflowE2ETests`: the run completes, `runtimeSnapshot.sandboxExecution.provider` is `docker`, and `runtimeSnapshot.tokenUsage` reflects the (stubbed) model response.

Expected result: `e2e-tests-agent-sandboxed` exits 0 and the test passes.

Equivalent manual sequence:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.e2e.yml --profile agent-sandboxed build agent-runner-image

docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.e2e.yml --profile agent-sandboxed \
  up --build -d postgres-agent-sandboxed migrate-agent-sandboxed wiremock api-agent-sandboxed

curl --fail --retry 60 --retry-delay 2 http://localhost:8085/api/health/live

docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.e2e.yml --profile agent-sandboxed build e2e-tests-agent-sandboxed
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.e2e.yml --profile agent-sandboxed run --rm e2e-tests-agent-sandboxed
```

This path only became possible after four fixes made while building this scenario, all worth knowing about if you're debugging it:

- `DockerSandboxExecutor` used to hard-code `NetworkMode = "none"` regardless of the requested `SandboxNetworkPolicy`, which meant *no* sandboxed task that needed network access (deployment profiles, `agent_sandboxed`, anything beyond `offline`) could ever work through the local Docker fallback. It now maps anything other than `SandboxNetworkAccessMode.None` to Docker's plain `bridge` network. Plain bridge can't enforce the per-host allow-listing `SandboxNetworkPolicy.AllowedHosts` implies — there's no egress proxy in this provider — so this is "the sandbox can reach the network" parity with OpenSandbox's Restricted mode, not allow-list enforcement; treat it as a local development convenience, not a security boundary.
- `AnthropicLanguageModelClient` used to only set `HttpClient.BaseAddress` from `Anthropic:ApiBaseUrl`. The `Anthropic.SDK` package builds its request URLs from its own `AnthropicClient.ApiUrlFormat` property instead, which ignores `HttpClient.BaseAddress` entirely — so a configured `ApiBaseUrl` silently had no effect, and every call went to the real `api.anthropic.com` regardless of configuration. It now also sets `ApiUrlFormat`, which is what actually controls where requests go. `tests/Autofac.Agents.Tests/AnthropicLanguageModelClientTests.cs` pins this with a fake `HttpListener`-based server.
- `OpenSandboxApiClient.TryDecodeArtifactContent` rejected anything outside a `text/*`/`application/json`/`application/xml` content-type allowlist — but the deployed execd build (`opensandbox/execd:v1.0.18`) serves every `files/download` response as `application/octet-stream` regardless of the real file content, so this silently dropped every artifact, every time, against a real OpenSandbox server. Since `OpenSandboxedAgentRunner` depends on reading back `agent-run-result.json` to surface the real agent failure reason, every `agent_sandboxed` failure against OpenSandbox instead surfaced as a generic `"OpenSandbox command failed with exit code N: exit status N"` with no further detail. The content-type check is gone; the existing null-byte check is what actually distinguishes binary from text content.
- `Autofac.AgentRunner`'s `Program.cs` wrote `agent-run-result.json` via `Encoding.UTF8`, which (unlike the parameterless `File.WriteAllTextAsync` overload) emits a byte-order mark. `OpenSandboxedAgentRunner`'s `JsonSerializer.Deserialize` of that same file rejects a leading BOM as invalid JSON. Switched to a BOM-less UTF-8 encoding.

The combination of the last two bugs is why `agent_sandboxed` looked broken against OpenSandbox specifically: network egress, the egress sidecar, and execd were all working correctly the whole time (verified directly via the OpenSandbox API and `docker exec`, independent of Agentwerke) — the actual agent failure reason was just never reaching the surface.

#### Validating against the pilot OpenSandbox stack

The pilot stack (`docker/docker-compose.pilot-opensandbox.yml`, see Part A above) bootstraps a second workflow, "OpenSandbox Agent Execution (agent_sandboxed)", alongside the existing `sandbox.execute` one, using `Sandboxes:Provider=opensandbox` (the real server, not the local Docker fallback). Starting a run on it (from the UI or via `POST /api/runs`) now correctly exercises the full path through a real OpenSandbox server.

Without a real Anthropic API key, a run fails with a clean, specific error — `"LLM call failed: Anthropic rejected your authorization... invalid x-api-key"` — surfaced directly from `agent-run-result.json`, with `runtimeSnapshot.tokenUsage` populated from the (rejected) call's usage. To see it succeed end to end, set `ANTHROPIC__APIKEY` in `docker/.env.pilot.local` (same file and variable name `docker-compose.pilot.yml`'s Scenario D uses) and pass `--env-file` when starting the stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.pilot-opensandbox.yml \
  --env-file docker/.env.pilot.local \
  up --build
```

This only takes effect on a freshly created `api` container — if it's already running from a prior `up` without `--env-file`, recreate it (`docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.pilot-opensandbox.yml --env-file docker/.env.pilot.local up -d --force-recreate api`) rather than expecting the existing container to pick up the new value.

## Part B — Production: OpenSandbox in Kubernetes mode with a secure runtime

Production should default to `Sandboxes:Provider: opensandbox` with the server running in Kubernetes mode, never `docker`. The Helm chart's `sandbox` values block (`deploy/helm/agentwerke/values.yaml`) wires this:

```yaml
sandbox:
  provider: opensandbox
  openSandbox:
    enabled: true
    serverUrl: "http://opensandbox.opensandbox.svc.cluster.local:8080/v1"
    useServerProxy: true
```

Store the OpenSandbox API key (if the server requires one) in the `agentwerke-secrets` Secret under key `OPEN_SANDBOX_API_KEY` — the chart reads it as optional, so omitting it is fine for servers that don't require auth.

### Step 1: Deploy OpenSandbox itself

This is out of scope for Agentwerke's chart — deploy OpenSandbox's server in Kubernetes mode using its own manifests/chart per https://github.com/opensandbox-group/OpenSandbox. Configure its sandbox pod template to use a Kata `RuntimeClass` (or Kata+Firecracker, depending on your isolation requirement — see the table below). This is the cluster operator's responsibility, not Agentwerke's; Agentwerke never creates the sandbox pods directly when using the `opensandbox` provider.

### Step 2: Cluster validation checklist (manual)

- [ ] `kubectl get runtimeclass` shows the Kata runtime class the OpenSandbox server is configured to use.
- [ ] A sandbox created through OpenSandbox's own API/CLI shows `spec.runtimeClassName: kata` (or your Kata+Firecracker class name) on `kubectl get pod -n <opensandbox-namespace> <sandbox-pod> -o yaml`.
- [ ] `kubectl exec` into a sandbox pod and confirm the kernel is the Kata guest kernel, not the host kernel (e.g. `uname -r` differs from a host node's kernel version) — this is the concrete evidence the workload is in a microVM, not a shared-kernel container.
- [ ] The OpenSandbox server's network policy for sandbox pods matches what `Autofac.Sandboxes.SandboxProfileCatalog`'s profiles expect (e.g. the `repo-write` profile's `AllowedHosts` for GitHub).
- [ ] Deploy `deploy/helm/agentwerke` with `sandbox.openSandbox.serverUrl` pointing at the in-cluster OpenSandbox service, then run a real workflow through to completion and confirm the run's evidence pack records `Provider: OpenSandbox` (see `SandboxExecutionResult.Provider`).
- [ ] Kill a sandbox pod mid-execution and confirm Agentwerke surfaces a clean failure (not a hang) — exercises the same failure path covered by `OpenSandboxIntegrationTests.ExecuteAsync_NonZeroExit_ReturnsFailureWithExitCode`, but against a real disruption instead of a non-zero exit.

There is no automated CI job for this checklist — it requires a real cluster with Kata installed, which this repository does not provision. Treat it as a release-gate manual step before promoting a cluster to serve production traffic.

## Security differences: Docker/runc, gVisor, Kata, Kata+Firecracker

| Runtime | Isolation model | Kernel exposure | Relative overhead | Agentwerke's stance (ADR-003) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Docker/runc | OS containers (namespaces + cgroups) | Shares the host kernel | Lowest | Local development and CI only. Not a production isolation boundary for untrusted or LLM-generated code. |
| gVisor | Userspace kernel intercepting syscalls | Shares the host kernel, but syscalls are intercepted/sandboxed by gVisor's Sentry | Low–medium | Valid secondary production option when operational simplicity is prioritized over the strongest isolation boundary. |
| Kata Containers | MicroVM (lightweight VM) per pod, OCI-compatible | Dedicated guest kernel per sandbox | Medium | Default production target. Strong boundary suitable for untrusted/LLM-generated code, fits Kubernetes/CRI/OCI deployment patterns Agentwerke already targets. |
| Kata + Firecracker | MicroVM via the Firecracker VMM specifically | Dedicated guest kernel, minimal device model | Medium-high (faster boot, smaller attack surface than other VMM backends) | Use when a platform owner wants the tightest microVM posture and can operate it. Same Kata RuntimeClass mechanism, different VMM underneath. |

The practical takeaway: only Kata and Kata+Firecracker give a sandboxed task its own kernel. Docker/runc and gVisor both still share the host kernel — gVisor narrows that exposure considerably via syscall interception, but it is not equivalent to a microVM boundary. Agentwerke treats Docker/runc as local-only, gVisor as an acceptable secondary production option, and Kata-class runtimes as the production default.
